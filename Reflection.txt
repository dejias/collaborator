The murkiest points: I’m a little confused about the “stash” function in git. I understand that it is used for temporarily saving changes that are not yet staged. As commits are stored as “snapshots” in git, I was wondering how git store stashed files?I’m confident in doing basic git operations like pulls and pushes, switching branches, adds and commits, searching for files and previous commit history, dealing with remotes, etc.I think I need more work on amending or deleting previous commits. Also, the short notation like ^r1 r2, r1…r2 need more time and practices to remember.
